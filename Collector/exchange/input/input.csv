Formulating some thing as beautiful as this is a really wonderful way to make people actually want to wear sunscreen! I consider this to be a wonderful base for make up.

Why wasn’t this around when I was younger?";"This product works, it does not break me out,  and I’ve bought it more times than I can count.Why wasn’t this around when I was younger? One reason I was not great about sunscreen in my younger years was that every formula seemed to break me out. There’s so many choices now, which is really great. A good way to get people to want to wear sunscreen is to make a silky, elegant product that’ll enhance different skin types rather than working against it. Elta does a pretty brilliant job with this.  Aging, acne prone skin is what my deal is, and this light, glowy sunscreen is perfect for me. Love that it’s fragrance free. I have tried the tinted before, and it’s fine, but this one is my favorite. Zero white cast, though I’m pretty pale anyway.  As someone who cannot use primer-(they ALL break me out) I especially love this product because I feel it’s a really nice base for make up. It’s one of those products that imparts a subtle glow that works for me. Most products that are “glowy” or “dewy” wind up making me shiny and oily, but this is just lovely.  I apply it after my vitamin C, give it a few minutes to set, and am good to apply makeup. Absorbs quickly.  This absolutely does not pill up, even if I apply two coats over other product.  I’ve been using this for so long that I’m a little freaked to try out anything different, but I did just order a Color Science all mineral sunscreen, so we shall see.  This Elta formula consists of both physical and chemical blockers, so that’s something to consider. Some people want zero chemical. Personally, I’m fine with the combo, as I know it’ll always work beautifully!";"Al";"4/17/23";"True";"0";"0";"2023-07-20"

However, even for my dry skin, the finish is a bit too dewy. On someone with more oily skin, this would be downright greasy. I’m also rather pale and my skin tone is cool, but this shade is truly pink! Not pinky-beige but actually a cool apricot color. I’m able to make it work but it does look a bit odd. This probably works very well for extremely fair, cool skin tones — think folks that freckle very easily. Overall, cosmetically elegant and really hydrating.

I've been using chemical exfoliators since learning how silicone beads can scar or damage your skin - but this stuff is gold. It's a rice powder, which is much finer (reducing risk of damage/scarring) and the lactic acid sloughs off dead skin. I also LOVE the scent of Eminence products (compared to a line like BR) and I never feel like I'm compromising my skin health to smell delicious. Only downside: the product cap twists to open 6 small holes that you can shake the powder out through (kind of like a salt shaker). It can be tough to easily shake the powder into your hand since the product builds up in those slots if moist, or gets stuck in the twist contraption.";"Liliana";"4/20/20";"True";"0";"0";"2023-07-20"

I don't find it drying, but I have fairly oily, acne-prone skin and live in a humid climate; others might need to alternate this with another cleanser. I only wish it were less expensive and easier to find; Dermstore is the best and most affordable vendor I've encountered.";"Andrea";"10/4/22";"True";"0";"0";"2023-07-20"

My friend in college had gone to her dermatologist for breakouts, and he recommended she use PCA Skin. That was when I first tried it, because she let me borrow it to try it too. I've seriously not bought any other brand of face wash or acne cream since that day. It is the product I've been searching for since I was a teenager. LIFE CHANGING!!! I recommend using the BPO 5% cleanser, and then this acne cream as a spot treatment. It's very effective, but not at all harsh on your skin. I am obsessed, and my skin has been amazing since I started using this product. I got my husband converted too :) He uses it everyday, as do I.

I apply this serum to the cheeks for freckles, to redness around the nose, and to more porous areas. I can notice a difference in clarity if I forget it for long. It's a product that can be applied selectively or to the entire face, depending on need, skin type, and regimen. As someone with normal-dry leaning skin and occasional dehydration, I'm able to use it 2-4x per week, sometimes layered with other active products, without irritation. I attribute this to the well-balanced formula of brightening, yet gentle (and hydrating) acids, reparative oils, and antioxidants. I just have to watch the 6mo open bottle date. Those with oilier skin or who prefer a single-serum night routine may tolerate more heavy usage, and the inclusion of bakuchiol makes this serum a good choice. If layering, it's good to wait about 10 minutes for absorption, as the product is moderately tacky. It has minimal scent and comes in opaque, airtight packaging.";"Katherine";"5/30/20";"True";"8";"5";"2023-07-20"

My makeup application is less and thus faster. I use this every night along with the Molecular Saviour Probiotics Repair Mist, Triple Hyaluronic Antioxidant Hydration Serum, and Molecular Multiâ€Nutrient Day Cream ( I use this cream day and night).

So naturally, I was apprehensive about this product but because mandelic acid is one of the gentler exfoliating acids, I hoped I'd have good luck. I wasnt wrong!! If you have sensitive, combo leaning towards dry, pores that are prone to clogging skin- this product might be for you!

I have to make sure I don't use other actives and I do a good face oil with it, too. Worth the trouble. It's almost gotten rid of everything and it's only been a couple of weeks. I also appreciate that it has BHA in it, so I don't have to worry about dealing with my stubborn nose comedones separately.

Not to mention their exceptional value. I am on a quest to find the right moisturizer, and given how much I love the product line, I really wanted this to be THE ONE. Unfortunately, even though it felt hydrating, it did not not agree with my sensitive skin. After I applied the moisturizer, my skin turned bright red. I gave it about 30 minutes to see if my skin would calm down, but ultimately I had to wash it off and use significantly more mild product. The issue with my skin is hardly the fault of the product, so I did not deduct any stars for my reaction to the moisturizer. But I do have to dock a star because the moisturizer never fully absorbed into my skin. I hate anything that leaves a residue or simply leaves product behind because then I never quite feel clean.

The reviews were glowing and I was sold! I began using it immediately upon its arrival. After wearing it for one day, I noticed that the thin lines under my eyes became a little more pronounced. I took noticed but decided to continue using it as I liked the texture and the smell of the cream. After using it for several days, the thin lines became even more pronounced and I noticed that more tiny wrinkly lines appeared that weren't there before. Shocked that an eye cream could actually cause wrinkles, I decided to test it one last time. Before going to bed, I put some cream under and around my eyes as well as between my eyebrows. I woke up with pronounced tiny wrinkles between my eyebrows, the wrinkles that weren't there before (or if they were, they were hardly noticeable). I contacted customer service and initiated the return. (I am very happy with the return policy at the DermStore!) It could be that my skin type conflicts with one or several ingredients in this particular eye cream. I wouldn't necessarily dissuade the next buyer from purchasing it, however, I would want her to be ware of the possible negative effects this eye cream may have on her skin as well.";"Anonymous";"2/13/17";"True";"9";"3";"2023-07-20"

This seemed to have good reviews so I got it. While it does not give me the same powdery hair effect that physical SPFs do, I find that it still gets in my hair because it doesn't really dry down even though it's a ""dry touch"" sunscreen. It stays sticky and makes my neck feel like it's sweaty and itchy. It is also a bit thick and takes a bit of time to rub in.

To solve this problem, I apply this sunscreen in front of a makeup mirror and clean off any excess ""white marks"" with a damp tissue. Then I am good to go.

I could get around the ""hard to use"" feature if it gave me the results I want, however baby powder is easier & better for my hair than this. This is impossible for me to get blended in or brushed out and when I do, I still have oily hair. I have been around the block SEVERAL times looking for dry shampoos and I'm irritated at myself for hanging on to this and using it too much to return it because my $6 one works better. I'd love to find a better aerosol-free one. I should give this 2 stars for my experience with it but I can't bring myself to do that to Briogeo.";"Laura";"8/19/18";"True";"0";"0";"2023-07-20"

I have no problem with the applicator or the consistency. I have no problem with how it spreads and love the fact that it has spf in it. But I have personally found that it does not reduce puffiness or cover up my dark circles in any capacity. For a little backgound, I have fair skin, so maybe this works better on those with a darker skin tone, but I get better coverage from cheap drug store makeup.

Cons: messy on your fingers, not super hygienic, and sometimes hard to get in small areas (clumps when I apply to my Cupid’s bow). I notice it doesn’t stay on my skin very long, however I do have oily skin so that could be the cause.

I have had acne, melasma, zits , all kinds of skin issues that I was covering up for years. Dry, powder, cream it doesnt matter you name it, I have tried all brands, and threw so much money away. It would take me hours to get ready because I could never find the right SKin tone for foundation, so I would put on more or mix colors, always its such a headache. NOW ,just a little bit of concelear from Dermstore, then I put this on, almost all over my face, to make it look like a lit from within, beaming, goddess look. It is incredible how it does not look wet, it does not look like caked on power, it looks SOOOO natural. Now I dont have to put much makeup on my face at all. Its truly a MIRACLE ! I will use this everywhere , in the center of my forehead. I put it on my eyes, on my water line,corners of my eyes, down the center of my nose,my entire upper lip, i add a bit more on my cupids bow, on my temples. This is a miracle product seriously. It has changed the way I do my makeup, and I feel like I look like myself. No ashy ghost face, no dark orange weird coloring. I can literally wear my own skin, tiny conceler, than use this to reflect light everywhere. Then I use a Cream blush (or rose lipstick ) for some blush, and lip color. THIS CHANGED MY LIFE ! BYEBYE CAKED ON MAKEUP ! HELLO MY NATURAL SKIN GLOWING THRU ! I have way less breakouts, less clogged pores, less of all the issues I had for years trying to put more color/foundation on my face. LESS IS MORE with the right product, you look like you, JUST FRESHER THAN EVER :) Im in love forever. Whoever made this is a literal angel to me. I HAD TO LEAVE A REVIEW BC ITS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

It would probably be OK if used with a beauty blender. When patted on with a finger and blended it lifts up foundation. I'll use it on very natural makeup days (maybe no foundation days) because it gives a nice subtle glow but I wouldn't repurchase.";"Anonymous";"10/22/18";"False";"0";"0";"2023-07-20"

Its too dramatic for my complexion, I wish I would have bought the buriti bronzer instead. I use it on my eyelids and lips more than the face .. it's pretty intense.
